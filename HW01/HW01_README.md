### Homework 01 Instructions

#### Credits and source code:
This code is done by Abdelrahman Fathy Abdelrahman.
Source code can be found on his Github repository: https://github.com/Abdelrahman912/Applied-FEM-Homeworks/tree/main/HW01

#### Type of files in this folder:
1. Matlab files (i.e. .m files).
2. HTML file
3. Julia (pluto notebook) files (i.e. .jl files).


#### Matlab Files:
There are three Matlab files:
1. Forward Iteration function (i.e. "forward_iter.m")
2. Inverse Iteration function (i.e. "inverse_iter.m")
3. The script for solving the tasks and displaying the results (i.e. "tasks_script.m") 

#### HTML File:
This is a HTML that include all the **julia code** and the **explanation** for all the tasks, 
and to run it just double click on the file and the file will be opened in your default browser.

After opening the file, everthing you see is runned already but in readonly mode, nevetheless 
if you want to edit the code or the LaTeX there are two options:
1. On the top right corner you will see a button *edit or run this notebook*, just click it and then choose *binder* to
run the notebook on the cloud (in this option you don't need to install julia at all).
2. Open julia file (see instructions in the next section).


#### Julia (Pluto Notebook) file:
This is a pluto notebook julia file and to open it you need to install *julia* and *pluto*.

To install julia and pluto: https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/
